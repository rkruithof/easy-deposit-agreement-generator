SYNOPSIS \u00b6 easy-deposit-agreement-generator generate [{--input|-i} <path>] [{--output|-o} <path>] easy-deposit-agreement-generator run-service DESCRIPTION \u00b6 A command line tool that creates a pdf document containing the deposit agreement for a given dataset. The tool uses the provided metadata on the dataset and the depositor to generate the deposit agreement. easy-deposit-agreement-generator uses a template with placeholders. After replacing the placeholders with actual data, the template is converted into a PDF file. Placeholder substitution is achieved using Apache Velocity , which fills in and merges a number of template HTML files that are specified in src/main/assembly/dist/res/template/ . Besides data from the dataset, several files in src/main/assembly/dist/res/ are required, namely dans_logo.png , agreement_version.txt , Metadataterms.properties and velocity-engine.properties . Pdf generation based on the assembled HTML is done using the command line tool WeasyPrint . Note that this tool requires to be installed before being used by easy-deposit-agreement-generator . A --preview or -p flag can be added to the command line tool to signal that a 'preview agreement' needs to be created. This version of the agreement can be created when the deposit has net yet been submitted. Also in the title of the agreement it is clearly indicated that this version is a preview . ARGUMENTS \u00b6 Options: -h, --help Show help message -v, --version Show version of this program Subcommand: generate - Generate a deposit agreement -i, --input <arg> The location of the JSON file containing the request -o, --output <arg> The location for resulting PDF containing the Deposit Agreement -h, --help Show help message --- Subcommand: run-service - Starts EASY Deposit Agreement Generator as a daemon that services HTTP requests -h, --help Show help message --- INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION \u00b6 The preferred way of install this module is using the RPM package. This will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-deposit-agreement-generator , the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-deposit-agreement-generator , and will install the service script for initd or systemd . If you are on a system that does not support RPM, you can use the tarball. You will need to copy the service scripts to the appropriate locations yourself. General configuration settings can be set in src/main/assembly/dist/cfg/appliation.properties and logging can be configured in src/main/assembly/dist/cfg/logback.xml . The available settings are explained in comments in aforementioned files. WeasyPrint is installed according to the installation page or via: yum install redhat-rpm-config python-devel python-pip python-lxml cairo pango gdk-pixbuf2 libffi-devel weasyprint After this, weasyprint --help is supposed to show the appropriate help page.
